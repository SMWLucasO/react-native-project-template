# The react native project template
This template contains a bunch of features generally wanted within a React Native project, such that it is easy to start developing as soon as possible.

## Features

### An opinionated linter

### First-class testing

## Get started

To get started, replace all `YOUR_APP_NAME_HERE` keywords existent within the template. Every single instance of that keyword must be replaced, including folder names.
Really, everything! Yes, that too.

Afterwards, make sure that the `kotlinVersion` in the `android/build.gradle` is the correct version. This can be checked by following [this particular part of Detox's setup guide](https://wix.github.io/Detox/docs/introduction/project-setup/#41-patching-build-scripts), after the part with `kotlinVersion = 'x.y.z`.

Then, you should be able to make use of this template.
